1. Create a function that accepts a list of large text files and then using
`multiprocessing`, parses each file in parallel, calculates the number of words 
and returns the sum of words from all files.

2. Implement a sorting algorithm (e.g. quicksort) and use `multiprocessing` to
parallelize sort list division. Combine sorted lists into one resulting list.

3. Define a math function and then use `multiprocessing` to compute in parallel
function values for different parameter sets.

4. Create a multi-threaded job queue in which several threads process jobs in 
parallel. The tasks can be anything, such as image processing.

5. Use `multithreading` to monitor different system resources simultaneously,
such as CPU, memory and disk usage. Update results every second.

6. Use `multithreading` to asynchronously make multiple HTTP requests to 
different ones servers. Use the `requests` module.

7. Create a multi-threaded version of the Monte Carlo algorithm for 
approximating Pi. Use one process per thread.

8. Use `multiprocessing` to process multiple audio files simultaneously. 
Everyone the thread deals with another file and the results are collected 
together.

9. Implement an image processing application using multiple threads. Every 
threadprocesses another part of the image.

10. Use `multiprocessing` to process a large set of data simultaneously. Split 
the datainto fragments, and each process processes one fragment of data. Use 
any data or data from scikitlearn datasets modules.
