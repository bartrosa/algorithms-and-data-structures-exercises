3. Database Connection Manager
Description:
Design a database connection manager that ensures that
there is only one connection instance in the entire application.
Use it in a simple data management system.
Requirements:
• Singleton Connections: Create a Singleton class that
manages the connection to the database.
• Database Operations: Implement basic ones
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
• Security and Performance: Ensure safe and
efficient connection to the database.
• Testing: Allows you to test the connection to the database
data by performing several operations.
Libraries/API:
• SQLAlchemy or PyMySQL (to manage connection to
MySQL or other database).
• SQLite (as an alternative to local testing without
remote database needs).
