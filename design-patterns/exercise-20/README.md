20. Iterator for Multidimensional Data Structures
Description:
Design a system that allows for iterative traversal
multidimensional data structures such as matrices or
tensor data structures, in various directions and dimensions.
Requirements:
• Multidimensional Iterator: Implement an iterator that
enables traversal of multidimensional structures
data.
• Iteration Configurability: Configurable
direction and dimension of iteration.
• Usage Demonstration: Example of using iterator in
operations on multidimensional data structures.
• Flexibility and Extensibility: Easy to adapt
iterator to different types of data structures.
Libraries/API:
• numpy or similar libraries to handle operations on
matrices or tensors.
