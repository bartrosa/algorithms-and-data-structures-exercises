# 1. Weather Report Generating System

## Description:
Create a system that generates personalized weather reports
for different cities using the public weather API (e.g.
OpenWeatherMap). The system should allow the user to
selecting the report format (e.g. text, HTML, JSON).
## Requirements:
- Report Factory: Use the factory pattern for authoring
different types of reports.
- Weather API Integration: Use the free one
API for downloading weather data.
- Flexibility: The code should be easy to extend
new report formats.
- User Interaction: Enablement
user to select the city and report format.
Libraries/API:
- Requests (for communicating with the weather API).
- JSON (for handling data and generating reports in the
JSON).
- HTML (optional, for generating reports in
HTML).
