8. Adapter For Different Types of Databases
Description:
Design a system that allows interaction with different databases
data (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) using unified
interface. The system should allow execution
basic database operations such as reading and writing
data.
Requirements:
• Adapting Database Interfaces: Create adapters
for various database systems.
• Uniform Operations Interface: Provide a consistent interface
to perform operations on data.
• Modularity and Scalability: Easy to add
support for new databases.
• Sample Use: Demonstration of use
system with various databases in practice
scenario.
Libraries/API:
• ORMs such as SQLAlchemy (for interacting with various databases
data).
• Drivers for individual databases (e.g. PyMySQL,
psycopg2).
