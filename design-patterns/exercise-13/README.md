13. Proxy for Resource Access Control
Description:
Create a system using the Proxy pattern that controls access to
specific resources in the application, e.g. important documents or
confidential data. Proxy should require authentication before
granting access.
Requirements:
• Access Control Proxy: Implement a proxy that
requires authentication before providing access to the resource.
• Security: Ensure access to the resource
safe and controlled.
• Modularity: Can be easily expanded by
additional resources and authentication methods.
• Usage Demonstration: Example of proxy usage in
access control scenarios.
Libraries/API:
• getpass in Python (for secure password entry).
• hashlib (for secure storage and verification
passwords).
