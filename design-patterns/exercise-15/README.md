15. Sorting System with Different Strategies
Description:
Create a system that allows you to sort data using
various sorting algorithms. The user should be able to
choose which sorting algorithm to use (e.g. sort
bubble, insert, quick sort).
Requirements:
• Strategy Pattern for Sorting Algorithms:
Implement different sorting algorithms separately
strategies.
• Flexibility in Algorithm Selection: Enable
user to choose the sorting algorithm.
• Modularity: Easy to add new algorithms
sorting to the system.
• Usage Demonstration: Example use
system in various sorting scenarios.
Libraries/API:
• Standard Python libraries.
