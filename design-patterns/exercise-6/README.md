6. System for Creating Configuration for Multiple Environments
Description:
Design a system that allows you to create and manage
configurations for various environments (e.g. development, testing,
production), using the prototype pattern.
Requirements:
• Configuration Prototypes: Create prototype objects
configurations for different environments.
• Cloning and Customizing Configuration:
Allowing you to clone configurations from one environment to another
another with the possibility of modification.
• Maintain Consistency: Ensure that changes in
prototypes do not affect existing clones.
• Usage Demonstration: Example use of the system for
various configuration scenarios.
Libraries/API:
• YAML/JSON (for storage and manipulation
configurations).
• copy in Python (for deep cloning of objects).
