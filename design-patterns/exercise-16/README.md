16. Routing System with Various Strategies
Description:
Design a navigation system that allows for routing
routes using different strategies (fastest route, shortest
route, route avoiding traffic jams).
Requirements:
• Various Routing Strategies: Implement
different routing strategies as separate classes.
• Configurability of Strategy Selection: Enable
user to choose their preferred determination strategy
routes.
• Maps Integration: Use of map data
to demonstrate different strategies.
• Flexibility and Extensibility: Easy to add
new routing strategies.
Libraries/API:
• Map APIs, e.g. Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap.
• requests for queries to the map API (if required).
