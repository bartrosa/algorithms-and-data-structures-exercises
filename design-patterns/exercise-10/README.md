10. Decorator Enhancing Features with Additional Functionality
Description:
Design a system of decorators that add extra
functionality to functions, e.g. checking permissions,
caching results, error handling.
Requirements:
• Functional Decorators: Create decorators that
they add functionalities such as caching and checking
permissions, error handling.
• Versatility: Decorators should be applicable to
different types of functions.
• Ease of Use: Allowing easy application and
configuring decorators.
• Sample Implementations: Demonstration
practical use of decorators in various scenarios.
Libraries/API:
• functools in Python (for creating decorators
preserving function metadata).
• cachetools (for implementing caching).
