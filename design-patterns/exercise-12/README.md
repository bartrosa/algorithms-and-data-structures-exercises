12. Facade for Managing Complex Login Systems
Description:
Design a system with a facade that simplifies the login process
various application modules (e.g. logging into files, databases,
external services), providing a uniform login interface.
Requirements:
• Login System Facade: Create a facade that
offers a consistent interface to various login systems.
• Configurable: Allowing for easy configuration and
switching between different login methods.
• Flexibility and Extensibility: The system should be
easy to expand with new login methods.
• Action Demonstration: Example of using the system in
different parts of the application.
Libraries/API:
• logging in Python (to handle logging).
• Libraries for interacting with databases (e.g. SQLAlchemy).
• Libraries for communicating with external logging services.
