14. Caching Proxies for Network Services
Description:
Design a system using the Proxy pattern that is used for
caching responses from web services (e.g. weather API,
data services). The goal is to increase efficiency through
limiting the number of requests to the service.
Requirements:
• Caching Proxies: Implement a proxy that caches
responses from the web service.
• Performance Optimization: Reduce load
network and latency through caching.
• Cache Configurability: Allows configuration
cache lifetime and refresh rules.
• Usage Demonstration: Caching usage example
proxy with the selected API.
Libraries/API:
• requests in Python (for communicating with the API).
• cachetools or similar (for cache management).
