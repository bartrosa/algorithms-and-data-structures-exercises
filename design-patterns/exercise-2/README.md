2. Connection Management System with Various APIs
Description:
Design a system that allows you to connect and interact with
various APIs (e.g. Twitter API, GitHub API). The system should
allow you to easily add new API integrations without
the need to modify the existing code.
Requirements:
• API Connection Factory: Implement the factory pattern
to create connections to various APIs.
• Modularity: Each API should be supported
via a separate module.
• Configurability: The system should allow for easy
configuration of access to various APIs (API keys, tokens
access).
• Simple User Interaction: Enable
the user to choose the API and basic operations for
execution.
Libraries/API:
• Requests (for communication with external APIs).
• OAuth (for authentication on demanding websites
authorization, e.g. Twitter, GitHub).
• JSON (for handling data from the API).
